- **🌍 Multiple Languages**: Support for 16 languages including English, Spanish, German, Hindi, and more
- **🔊 Real-time Processing**: Instant transcription, translation, and speech synthesis
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **☁️ Serverless Architecture**: Fully serverless implementation on AWS

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](screenshots/VoiceTranslatorArc.gif)

This application uses a serverless architecture with the following AWS services:

- **📦 Amazon S3**: Hosts the static website and stores audio files
- **🌐 Amazon CloudFront**: Delivers the frontend with low latency
- **🔌 Amazon API Gateway**: Provides REST API endpoints
- **⚡ AWS Lambda**: Processes audio and orchestrates the translation workflow
- **🎯 Amazon Transcribe**: Converts speech to text
- **🔄 Amazon Translate**: Translates text between languages
- **🔊 Amazon Polly**: Converts translated text back to speech
- **📊 Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors and logs application activity

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User selects source and target languages
2. User records audio through the browser
3. Audio is sent to API Gateway and processed by Lambda
4. Lambda uses Transcribe to convert speech to text
5. Lambda uses Translate to translate the text
6. Lambda uses Polly to convert the translated text to speech
7. Results are displayed to the user

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (AWS Lambda)
- **AWS Services**: S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, Transcribe, Translate, Polly, CloudWatch
